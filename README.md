# Life Expectancy Prediction (Regression Task)

This repository is for Task 1 of our Machine Learning Assignment 1.

## Description
We use WHO health, economic, and demographic data to predict **life expectancy (years)**.
This is a regression problem.

## Structure
- `data/` → training data (not committed to GitHub)
- `notebooks/` → exploratory analysis (`data_exploration.ipynb`)
- `src/` → source code
  - `data_preprocessing.py`
  - `train_model.py`
  - `predict.py`
- `models/` → saved regression models (`.pkl`)
- `results/` → training metrics and predictions
- `report.pdf` → explanation, results, insights
